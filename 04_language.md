# What is the course?
AP (and non-AP) Computer Science Principles

Grades 10-12, Aimed for students with little to no background in programming.
# What is the language?
Snap!
# How does one write & run code in this language?
Snap is a block-based scripting language, writing is dragging units known as "blocks" while running is event-based and also may occur from clicking on the blocks!
# Rate the complexity of the syntax?
Honestly I would rate the complexity at one unit above English comprehension. It is a VERY high level language that tries its best to be reader-friendly.
# Strengths
* Easy readability
* Scripting interface comes with full documentation on each block/procedure.
* Color and shape schema illustrate implicit expectations for use.
* Constant support through BJC Piazza and yearly updates.
* Libraries open up higher level functionality for gifted students.
* BJC curriculum doles out a lot of great lab suggestions and ideas.
# How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
From early on I leveraged the "Help" documentation with students. I implored them to never use a block blindly just because the lab said to. The documentation contains examples and images to help students understand how each block is meant to be used and with which blocks they work well.

In addition, the readability has helped many, many students figure out what to do next or even on their own without the guidance of the written lab. It's a surprisingly effective language, so long as the effort is made!

# Weaknesses
* Differences in syntax can make their understanding of common language formats (indices in python, data types in Java/C, etc.) rather empty, making transition to AP CSA only marginally easier due to logical exposure.
* Snap does not do verbose errors, and can try to allow things that may or may not be the intended outcome.
* Students coming in with some text-based coding backgrounds may find the UI to be... demeaning of their abilities. Child-like if you will.
# How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
Fortunately since I'm cozy with programming in Snap I've been able to entertain the skillful coders in the group. I've also been aggressive in having students share error moments so that everyone is aware of what to avoid or how to fix certain debugging moments.

Finally, some classes have a majority of students who will be going on to AP CSA, and so those classes we usually introduce to Java right after the AP CSP examination.
# Why did you select this language for this class?
Personally while I do love Python as an educational language, I found it still struggled with students who are not too comfortable at the keyboard. Syntax errors, typos, and any other form of keyboard miscreation can frustrate many students. Snap avoids that, for the most part. In fact, Snap excels at helping students look at the logical components without worrying about syntax just yet. Which is perfect for my population which does not necessarily contain the best mathematicians or logicians of their age.
