It's admittedly the (only) IDE for Snap as a language.
## Classes Used
AP Computer Science Principles
## How is it used?
It's the IDE, so it's our script running tool along with our (most complete) API/documentation.

Because it's the only one that can run Snap :'(

# Tool Two
## Name
remove.bg
## Purpose
Removes backgrounds by turning them to "transparency layers"
## Classes Used
AP Computer Science Principles
## How is it used?
In goes image, out goes image "without" background!

Many students want to incorporate fun, custom sprites, but don't have access to photoshop or have the know-how to use GIMP or other programs, this is a quick one-and-done tool!
