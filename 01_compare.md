I'm trained on the BJC AP CSP curriculum, so my comparisons will be against the code.org AP CSP curriculum.

Personally, the biggest difference seems to be that code.org actually focuses much more on concepts and uses of technology before deep-diving into code, as opposed to BJC which encourages coding first before deep-diving into concept.

Otherwise, the topics covered don't seem to have major differences before the AP Create Task. However! Once we get past that, there's a major divergence. Code.org jumps more into data sciences, while BJC encourages more high level programming skills such as recursion. Personally I do enjoy the BJC lineup, but I do step into some more "digital native" topics after the AP Create Task so that students I have who aren't working towards AP CSA.
