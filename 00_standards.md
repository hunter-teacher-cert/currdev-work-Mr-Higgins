# 9-12.IC.7
Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.

A class task would be to explore Kaggle.com and see what contests are currently running/have found a winner on what topics or goals. This is a bit surface level, but for a class of students who are disinterested in computer science it might illuminate just how far the net of machine learning can go. It can lead to students being prompted to suggest fields that might benefit from such contests!

# 9-12.CT.5
Modify a function or procedure in a program to perform its computation in a different way over the same inputs, while preserving the result of the overall program.

A class task I enjoy in this is Iterative to Recursive and Recursive to Iterative activities, where programs that are either recursive or iterative needed to be remade in their opposing form with the same functionality. Students really get a feel for which situations lead to harder problems or easier solutions!
